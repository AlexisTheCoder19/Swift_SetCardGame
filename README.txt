CardGameSet - Swift App

	Name: Alexis Chan


Process of building the app
	Apply the knowledge learned from class about struct, enums, extensions, and our Concentration Swift app to build the card game Set. While building this app I incorporated techniques learned from our protocols class and drawing in ios class. The complication that i had was that my computer broke, because of this i had to start my game from scratch again. 

Process to Run App
	Select iphone 11 and press play on xcode and the game will start. User will have to select 3 cards to make a set following the rules of set. The user will have the ability to deal 3 more cards or start a new game. The game will keep track of your score, if the user gets a set the game wil give the user 3 points if they are not a set the game will deduct 4 points. If user deselects a card the game will deduct a point 

Instruction on The process

	from the knowledge that we got from concentration and our class I was able to develop the game set by: 

	a) display 12 cards in the begining of the game

	b) as the game continues the user will add 3 more cards when the deal button is pressed

	c) by doing so the game will show up to 24 cards on screen

	d) after the user has had 24 card on the screen the deal button will be dissabled

	e)when the user selects 3 cards the game will check if its a set

	f)if selected cards are not a set it will deduct points

	g) use NSAtributeString for the drawing of the cards

	i) add enums and extension to game
